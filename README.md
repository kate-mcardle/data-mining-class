=================

Graduate data mining class project, focused on examining the effects of demographic factors on two medical care outcomes: length of stay and total charges.

All analysis was performed in R, using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Generalized Boosted Regression models, as well as an ensemble of these models. Analysis is based on Patient Discharge Data from the state of California. Please see the report and slide deck for findings. 

All R files in this repository were written solely by Kate McArdle unless otherwise noted, while the report and slide deck were jointly written by Kate, Himanshu Chauhan, and Radhika Sundar. The report and slide deck feature analysis performed by all.
